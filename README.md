## Healthcare Cost Visualization Project
Welcome to the Healthcare Cost Visualization Project! This project is designed to help healthcare professionals, researchers, and analysts gain insights into healthcare cost patterns within the Singapore Health System. The visualization is facilitated through Google Colab, providing an accessible and collaborative environment for data analysis.

## Overview
The primary objectives of this project are:

- **Simulated Data Generation:** Utilize Numpy to generate simulated healthcare cost data across categories such as Hospitalization, Medication, Doctor Visits, Tests, and Others.

- **Data Storage:** Structure the generated data into a Pandas DataFrame, which is then saved as a CSV file named 'healthcare_costs_singapore.csv'.

- **Data Visualization:** Leverage Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations, including a pie chart for an overview of cost distribution and a bar graph for detailed category-wise comparisons.

- **Google Colab Integration:** The project is designed to be executed in a Google Colab notebook, ensuring ease of use, collaboration, and reproducibility.

## Getting Started
To explore and visualize healthcare cost data, follow these steps:

- **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-cost-visualization.git.

- **Open in Google Colab:** Open the notebook (notebook.ipynb) in Google Colab. Ensure you have the required libraries installed by running pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn in your Colab notebook.

- **Customization:** Replace the simulated data with your actual healthcare cost data, and modify the notebook as needed for your specific requirements.

## Project Structure
- **notebook.ipynb:** Google Colab notebook for data visualization.
- **healthcare_costs_singapore.csv:** Sample computer-generated CSV file containing simulated healthcare cost data.
